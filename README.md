Blender Files for your gorilla tag blender profile pictures!
This also has other games like Animal Company Player Model.

If your rig isn't showing in a Blender blend file, it's likely because either the armature object is hidden, on a different layer, or the viewport is set to a mode that doesn't display the bones (like wireframe) - check your layer visibility, object visibility, and the viewport shading mode to ensure the rig is properly displayed.
